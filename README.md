mlog
====

**Author**: Simon Mutch

A super simple MPI logging library.  This was written for the Meraxes
semi-analytic galaxy formation model as a lightweight replacement for the
[GBP_SID](https://github.com/gbpoole/gbpCode/tree/master/gbpLib/gbpSID)
library, which has a far greater scope than mlog, and far more features.
